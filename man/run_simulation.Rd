\arguments{
\item{n}{The number of observations in the simulated data set.}

\item{probability_exposed}{The probability that an observation is
in the 'exposed' group}

\item{probability_stratum_1_given_exposed}{The conditional
probability that an observation is in the first stratum given
that the observation is in the exposed group.}

\item{probability_stratum_1_given_unexposed}{The conditional
probability that an observation is in the first stratum given
that the observation is in the unexposed group.}

\item{risk_given_unexposed_stratum_2}{The risk of the outcome for
observations that are unexposed and in the second stratum.}

\item{relative_risk_exposed}{The relative risk of the outcome
associated with exposure.}

\item{relative_risk_stratum_1}{The relative risk of the outcome
associated with the first stratum.}
}
\value{
A list with entries \code{poisson_glm}, \code{modified_poisson_glm},
\code{log_binomial_glm}, and \code{mantel_haenszel}, each a list with
entries \code{est}, \code{ci}, \code{bias}, and \code{is_covered}.
